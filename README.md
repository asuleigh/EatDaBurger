ABSTRACT: This is a simple app built with MySQL, Node, Express, Express-Handlebars, and a homemade ORM. This app uses Node and mySQL to query and route data into the app, while Handlebars generates the html. The app allows the user to keep track of burgers they have eaten. The user starts by inputting a burger to eat and clicking submit, then burger is logged above the input on the left with a new button ("DEVOUR IT!"). Once the user clicks the "DEVOUR IT!" button, the burger posts as a "devoured" burger to the right with no further actions available aside from adding a new burger to devour.
